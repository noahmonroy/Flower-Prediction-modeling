```{r}
library(tidyverse)
iris <- read.csv("iris.csv")
```
```{r}
RNGversion("3.5.2")
set.seed(111) # use set.seed to use the same random number sequence as the tutorial
train_sample <- sample(150, 130)

# split the data frames
iris_train <- iris[train_sample, ]
iris_test  <- iris[-train_sample, ]

# check the proportion of class variable
prop.table(table(iris_train$species))

prop.table(table(iris_test$species))
```
Stage 1: Build test model using c50 function
```{r}
#Load the Decision Tree Algorithm package
install.packages("C50")
library(C50)
#The algorithm needs a factor type
iris_train$species<-as.factor(iris_train$species)
iris_test$species<-as.factor(iris_test$species)

#Train a Decision Tree Model
# Only use the first 4 columns as factors
# Use species variable as the DV
iris_model <- C5.0(iris_train[1:4], iris_train$species)

summary(iris_model)
#Look at summary. Strucutre of tree says that 45 iris-setosas fall into tree if petal length <= 1.9. If petal length > 1.9, petal width is divided into >1.7 (36 iris virginicas, 1 NOT iris virinica) or <= 1.7.The branch that is <= 1.7 has: iris versicolor (41), and iris virginica (4).  
```
Stage 2) Validation state using predict function
```{r}
iris_pred <- predict(iris_model, iris_test)

#prediction for testing data
iris_pred

#See how well did the model do for the testing data. That is the misclassification rate for testing dataset?

# cross tabulation of predicted versus actual classes
install.packages("gmodels")
library(gmodels)
CrossTable(iris_test$species, iris_pred,
           prop.chisq = FALSE, prop.c = FALSE, prop.r = FALSE,
           dnn = c('actual speciest', 'predicted species'))

#because all numbers are diagonals, misclassification rate = 0
```


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
